# hello-world
This repository contains my practices files for web development lessons

Hi, My name is Precious Chinweike. And my desire to become an excellent front-end web developer has led to me 'getting my fingers dirty' learning the major web techonologies like; HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
I can't wait to get up to speed and start build impactful web applications using these technologies.
